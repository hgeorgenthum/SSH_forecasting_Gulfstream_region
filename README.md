# SSH forecasting Gulfstream region

## Motivation

The goal is to investigate how to best perform forecasting of the Sea Surface High (SSH)
from partial satellite altimetry observations. This study is conduct into the Gulstream region (33째N;43째N, -65째W;-55째W).

## Observations


## Data sequence and use


## Data


## Baseline


## Evalution

The evaluation of the forecasting methods is based on the comparison of the SSH reconstructions with the baseline.
Two scores will be used in this study:
1. The Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE).
2. Another based on Fourier wavenumber spectra.
